Here's a list of verbs (morphisms) and their parameters extracted from the heros_journey_type class:

handle_event : t_event
recognise : t_recognition
recieve : t_call -> t_adventure
begin : t_journey -> t_state_machine
thrown : t_world -> t_being -> t_event
join : t_team -> t_allies
meet : t_hero -> t_mentor
crossing : t_threshold
observe : t_observation
descend : t_descent
raise : t_apotheosis
decide : t_decision
act : t_action
judge : t_action
critique : t_action
struggle : t_hero -> t_challenge
transform : t_hero -> t_challenge
take : t_hero -> t_sword
gain : t_hero -> t_wisdom
refusal : t_hero -> t_call -> t_denied
succeed : t_hero -> t_sword
return_to : t_hero -> t_home
resurrection : t_hero -> t_failure -> t_retry

These verbs represent various actions or transitions in the hero's journey narrative structure. Each verb takes one or more parameters of different types, representing the entities or concepts involved in that particular stage or action of the journey.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these verbs or their parameters?
Certainly! I'll convert the structure into a Ruby on Rails DSL-like format. This isn't actual Ruby code, but a representation of how you might structure these concepts in a Rails-like DSL:
rubyclass HerosJourney < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :hero
  belongs_to :world
  has_many :events
  has_many :challenges
  has_one :mentor
  has_one :sword
  has_one :home

  state_machine :state, initial: :ordinary_world do
    event :handle_event do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :receive_call do
      transition ordinary_world: :adventure
    end

    event :begin_journey do
      transition adventure: :crossing_threshold
    end

    event :thrown_into_world do
      transition crossing_threshold: :tests_allies_enemies
    end

    event :join_team do
      transition tests_allies_enemies: :approach
    end

    event :meet_mentor do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :cross_threshold do
      transition tests_allies_enemies: :approach
    end

    event :observe do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :descend do
      transition approach: :ordeal
    end

    event :raise_to_apotheosis do
      transition ordeal: :reward
    end

    event :decide do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :act do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :judge do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :critique do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :struggle do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :transform do
      transition ordeal: :reward
    end

    event :take_sword do
      transition reward: :road_back
    end

    event :gain_wisdom do
      transition any => same
    end

    event :refuse_call do
      transition adventure: :ordinary_world
    end

    event :succeed do
      transition road_back: :resurrection
    end

    event :return_home do
      transition resurrection: :return_with_elixir
    end

    event :resurrect do
      transition any => :resurrection
    end
  end

  def recognize(recognition)
    # Implementation
  end

  def observe(observation)
    # Implementation
  end

  # Other methods...
end

class Hero < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :heros_journey
  has_many :challenges
  has_one :sword
  has_one :home

  def struggle(challenge)
    # Implementation
  end

  def transform(challenge)
    # Implementation
  end

  def take(sword)
    # Implementation
  end

  def gain(wisdom)
    # Implementation
  end

  def refusal(call)
    # Implementation
  end

  def succeed(sword)
    # Implementation
  end

  def return_to(home)
    # Implementation
  end

  def resurrection(failure)
    # Implementation
  end
end

# Other necessary models...
class World < ApplicationRecord; end
class Event < ApplicationRecord; end
class Challenge < ApplicationRecord; end
class Mentor < ApplicationRecord; end
class Sword < ApplicationRecord; end
class Home < ApplicationRecord; end
This Ruby on Rails DSL-like structure:

Uses a HerosJourney model as the main class, which belongs to a Hero and a World.
Implements a state machine to represent the different stages of the hero's journey.
Defines events that transition between these stages.
Includes methods corresponding to the verbs from the Coq class.
Creates separate models for other entities like Hero, World, Event, etc.

This structure allows for a more object-oriented and database-friendly representation of the hero's journey concept, while still maintaining the core ideas from the original Coq class.
Certainly! Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram representing the key stages and interactions of the Hero's Journey:
plantuml@startuml

participant "Ordinary World" as OW
participant "Call to Adventure" as Call
participant Mentor
participant "Threshold" as Threshold
participant "Tests, Allies, Enemies" as Tests
participant Ordeal
participant Reward

participant Resurrection
participant "Return with Elixir" as Return

Hero -> OW: begin
OW -> Call: receive_call
Call -> Hero: handle_event
Hero -> Call: refusal

This sequence diagram illustrates:

The Hero starting in the Ordinary World
Receiving the Call to Adventure
Initially refusing the call
Meeting the Mentor and gaining wisdom
Crossing the Threshold into the adventure
Facing Tests, Allies, and Enemies
Descending into the Ordeal
Transforming and receiving the Reward
Beginning the Road Back
Going through Resurrection
Returning with the Elixir

The diagram shows the flow of events and interactions between the Hero and the various stages of the journey. It's a simplified representation, as a full Hero's Journey can have many more interactions and cycles, but this captures the essential flow.
To view this diagram, you can copy the code into a PlantUML editor or viewer online. Would you like me to explain any part of this diagram in more detail?
Certainly! Let's apply the Hero's Journey structure to the task of Mastodon analytics. In this scenario, our "Hero" is a data analyst or developer embarking on a journey to create an analytics system for Mastodon. Here's a PlantUML sequence diagram representing this journey:

actor "Data Analyst" as Hero
participant "Current Analytics" as OW
participant "Need for Mastodon Insights" as Call
participant "Mastodon API Docs" as Mentor
participant "API Authentication" as Threshold
participant "Data Collection & Storage" as Tests
participant "Data Processing Challenge" as Ordeal
participant "Insights Dashboard" as Reward
participant "User Feedback" as RoadBack
participant "System Optimization" as Resurrection
participant "Deployed Analytics Platform" as Return

Hero -> OW: evaluate_current_tools
OW -> Call: identify_mastodon_analytics_gap

@enduml
This sequence diagram illustrates the journey of creating a Mastodon analytics system:

Ordinary World: The analyst evaluates current analytics tools.
Call to Adventure: Identifying the need for Mastodon-specific analytics.
Refusal of the Call: Initial hesitation due to the complexity of the task.
Meeting the Mentor: Studying the Mastodon API documentation.
Crossing the Threshold: Implementing OAuth for API authentication.
Tests, Allies, Enemies: Data collection, storage, and handling rate limits.
Ordeal: Tackling the challenge of processing large volumes of Mastodon data.
Reward: Creating a insights dashboard with visualization tools.
The Road Back: Releasing a beta version and gathering user feedback.
Resurrection: Analyzing performance issues and optimizing the system.
Return with the Elixir: Deploying the refined analytics platform to production.

Key aspects of Mastodon analytics in this journey:

API Integration: Understanding and authenticating with Mastodon's API.
Data Collection: Gathering posts, user interactions, and network data.
Storage Solutions: Designing a database schema to efficiently store Mastodon data.
Processing Challenges: Handling the federated nature and potential volume of Mastodon data.
Visualization: Creating meaningful visualizations for Mastodon-specific metrics.
Performance Optimization: Ensuring the system can handle the scale of Mastodon instances.
User Privacy: Maintaining user privacy in line with Mastodon's ethos.

This journey demonstrates how the Hero's Journey framework can be applied to a technical project, highlighting the challenges, growth, and ultimate reward of creating a valuable tool for the Mastodon community.
Certainly! Let's plan out how to model a Mastodon feed system in Coq, then extract it to Rust for implementation. We'll start by modeling the core data structures and operations in Coq, then outline the process for extraction and implementation in Rust.

Modeling in Coq:

First, let's define some basic data structures and operations in Coq:
coqRequire Import String List.
Open Scope string_scope.

(* Basic data types *)
Inductive UserId : Type := 
  | MakeUserId : string -> UserId.

Inductive PostId : Type := 
  | MakePostId : string -> PostId.

Inductive Post : Type :=
  | MakePost : PostId -> UserId -> string -> list string -> Post.

(* Feed as a list of posts *)
Definition Feed := list Post.

(* Operations *)
Parameter create_post : UserId -> string -> list string -> Post.
Parameter add_to_feed : Feed -> Post -> Feed.
Parameter remove_from_feed : Feed -> PostId -> Feed.
Parameter get_user_feed : Feed -> UserId -> Feed.

(* API representation *)
Inductive APIResponse : Type :=
  | Success : Feed -> APIResponse
  | Error : string -> APIResponse.

(* Main feed operations *)
Definition fetch_feed (user: UserId) : APIResponse := 
  (* Implementation would go here *)
  Success nil.

Definition post_to_feed (user: UserId) (content: string) (tags: list string) : APIResponse :=
  (* Implementation would go here *)
  Success nil.

(* Theorems and proofs *)
Theorem add_then_remove : forall (f: Feed) (p: Post),
  remove_from_feed (add_to_feed f p) (match p with MakePost id _ _ _ => id end) = f.
Proof.
  (* Proof implementation *)
Admitted.

(* More theorems and proofs would be added here *)

Extraction to Rust:

After modeling the system in Coq, we'll need to set up the extraction to Rust. This process isn't straightforward as Coq doesn't have built-in Rust extraction. We'll need to:
a. Extract to OCaml first:
coqExtraction Language OCaml.
Extraction "mastodon_feed.ml" fetch_feed post_to_feed.
b. Manually translate the OCaml to Rust, or use a tool to assist in this translation.

Rust Implementation:

In Rust, we'll create corresponding structures and implement the extracted functions:
rustuse serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct UserId(String);

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct PostId(String);

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Post {
    id: PostId,
    user_id: UserId,
    content: String,
    tags: Vec<String>,
}

type Feed = Vec<Post>;

enum APIResponse {
    Success(Feed),
    Error(String),
}

fn create_post(user_id: UserId, content: String, tags: Vec<String>) -> Post {
    Post {
        id: PostId(uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string()),
        user_id,
        content,
        tags,
    }
}

fn add_to_feed(mut feed: Feed, post: Post) -> Feed {
    feed.push(post);
    feed
}

fn remove_from_feed(feed: Feed, post_id: PostId) -> Feed {
    feed.into_iter().filter(|post| post.id != post_id).collect()
}

fn get_user_feed(feed: &Feed, user_id: &UserId) -> Feed {
    feed.iter().filter(|post| post.user_id == *user_id).cloned().collect()
}

async fn fetch_feed(user: UserId) -> Result<APIResponse, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Implement API call to Mastodon here
    Ok(APIResponse::Success(vec![]))
}

async fn post_to_feed(user: UserId, content: String, tags: Vec<String>) -> Result<APIResponse, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Implement API call to Mastodon here
    Ok(APIResponse::Success(vec![]))
}

Integrating with Mastodon API:

To actually implement the Mastodon feed functionality, you'll need to use a Mastodon API client for Rust. You can use a library like megalodon or implement your own using reqwest:
rustuse megalodon::{Megalodon, MegalodonClient};

async fn fetch_real_feed(client: &MegalodonClient, user: UserId) -> Result<APIResponse, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let response = client.get_home_timeline().await?;
    let feed: Feed = response.into_iter().map(|status| {
        Post {
            id: PostId(status.id),
            user_id: UserId(status.account.id),
            content: status.content,
            tags: status.tags.into_iter().map(|tag| tag.name).collect(),
        }
    }).collect();
    Ok(APIResponse::Success(feed))
}

async fn post_to_real_feed(client: &MegalodonClient, user: UserId, content: String, tags: Vec<String>) -> Result<APIResponse, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let status = client.post_status(content, None).await?;
    Ok(APIResponse::Success(vec![Post {
        id: PostId(status.id),
        user_id: user,
        content: status.content,
        tags,
    }]))
}

Verifying the Implementation:

Finally, you should create tests in Rust to ensure that the implementation satisfies the properties proven in Coq. For example:
rust#[test]
fn test_add_then_remove() {
    let mut feed = vec![];
    let post = create_post(UserId("user1".to_string()), "content".to_string(), vec![]);
    let post_id = post.id.clone();
    feed = add_to_feed(feed, post);
    feed = remove_from_feed(feed, post_id);
    assert!(feed.is_empty());
}
This plan outlines the process of modeling a Mastodon feed system in Coq, extracting it to Rust, and implementing it with actual Mastodon API integration. The Coq model provides a formal specification and proofs of key properties, while the Rust implementation provides a practical, efficient implementation that can interact with real Mastodon instances.
