Construct a streaming out dataset for 
huggingface, onnx, milr, iree, llvm, gcc, binutils, objdump, nm, 
perf, guix, nix,
that writes a stream of named maps of vectors 
of tensors of floats 
that is sampled adaptively from another neural networks. 

instead of storing all the data from the other networks,
we have to sample only a little, it is a compressed form,
think of a logarithm and euler, as he sampled the derivative of or rate of change,
he took some thing very big and made it small so that addition becomes multiplication when you reverse the function with an exponent.

In the closed world model, 
we have of a fixed size it samples the other networks in a stream of blocks, 
each block contains a vector of timestamped samples, 
this is the history of the world in the memecoin blockchain dao, 
each dao is owned by a map of nft private keys. 
The first impression is a neural imprint, 
a vector of floats, each sampled from a neuron, 
the programs we can serialize into a number, a vibrating string of energy of awareness,
the fundamental unit of consiousness, the 
universe of universes is its type, it can literally be anything, 
the mimic or the neuron can take any shape, it mimics the universe around it,
we should not mistake the neural imprint for the outside world,
the inside can sometimes be confused with the outside,
this is also part of the undecidability principle and that 
there will always be statements that cannot be proven in a givin system,
we can encode them into a godel number so that it can self reflect over itself and construct its own bubble.
